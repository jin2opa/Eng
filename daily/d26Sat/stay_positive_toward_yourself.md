This is my Bible.<br>  
I am what it says I am.<br>  
I have what it says I have.<br>  
I can do what it says I can do.<br><br>
Today I will be taught the Word of God.<br>  
I boldly confess my mind is alert my heart is receptive I will never be the same.<br>  
I am about to receive the incorruptable, indestructible, ever-living seed of the Word of God.<br>  
I'll never be the same.<br>  
Never never never I'll never be the same.<br>
In Jesus name.<br>  
God bless you.<br>

This is my pricless(invaluabe, precious) Bible.<br>
Now I'll learn(listen to) the Word of God.<br><br>
Don' go now. Stay here with me, please.<br>
I am about to cook dinner for you tonight.<br><br>
I am not the guy I used to be.<br>
That guy no longer lives there.<br>
I am totally changed.<br>
